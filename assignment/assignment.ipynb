        "1. This paper is about \"tidying\" data so that it is easier to manipulate later one.\n",
        "2. The \"tidy data standard\" is supposed to make analyzing data easier, and create a standard that data exploration tools treat easily.\n",
        "3. The metaphor about families means that tidy datasets all have the same attributes and have similar structures, but messy datasets all have their own unique problems. The sentence about ovservations and variables is saying that given the context of a dataset, it's easy to understand what the observations and variables are, but without that context, it's difficult to generalize what they are.\n",
        "4. He defines values as either qualitative or quantitative (strings or numbers). He defines a variable as containing all values with the same unit stemming from an attribute. He defines observations as containing all values with the same unit regardless across all attributes.\n",
        "5. He says that tidy data has 3 components: all variables are in columns, all observations are in rows, and every observational unit forms a table.\n",
        "6. The five most common problems with messey datasets are (1) values in the column header instead of names, (2) multiple variables in a single column, (3) variables as both rows and columns, (4) multiple types of observational units in the same table, and (5) multiple tables storing multiple observational units. The data in Table 4 is messy because it switched variables and observations. By \"melting\" the data, he means to turn the columns into rows.\n",
        "7. Table 11 is messy because every row is a month min or max, and every column is a day (and very few days actually have values). Table 12, on the other hand, it \"molten\" because every row is either day min or max and has a value.\n",
        "8. The \"chicken and the egg\" problem is that tidy data is contingent upon the availability of tools that can effectively work with it, and that the development of such tools depends on the existence and adoption of tidy data. Wickham hopes that in the future of data wrangling, methodologies from other fields, such as user-testing, ethnography, and talk-aloud protocols, will be incorporated, which will lead to a better understanding of human cognition of data analysis, and lead to an improvement of data analysis tools. Wickhan also anticipates that better data storage, new data formulations & more efficient tools will be created in the future ."
